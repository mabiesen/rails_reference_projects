*** OVERVIEW

1.  Stored data in a mysql database. (per Doug.  Probably could do Json)

2.  Model out all queries: no direct queries (security)

3.  Database will serve as version control: field would be required for active version



*** Normalized Data Model

VERSION TABLE IS MAIN TABLE:

1. Reference to company table through company ID

2. Reference to Text and Picture tables through version ID

2.  Page Version table input from user is page name and active version (NOTE: there can only be 1 active version). Created time system input.

3.  Text table user input is text location.  Text and pictures created as blocks, blocks are assigned chronological ids through system
